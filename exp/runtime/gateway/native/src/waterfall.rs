//! Native execution of the certified deployment waterfall.
//!
//! The control plane's `admit` returns the full ordered route (one wire
//! configuration per certified deployment) plus the frozen retry policy
//! facts; this module loops physical dispatches under the request deadline,
//! mirroring the python executor's semantics: each dispatch is durably
//! reserved through the `start_attempt` bridge callback immediately before
//! network work, same-deployment redials happen only for retryable failure
//! classes and only before commitment, a pre-commit throttle on a rung the
//! pool's `throttle_redial` schedule marks worth waiting for is re-dialed on
//! the same deployment after a bounded backoff (see `throttle_backoff`),
//! failover advances to the next certified deployment for failover-eligible
//! failures before commitment, and the first outward semantic event
//! permanently freezes the serving deployment. When the alias revision
//! enables refusal failover, refusal deltas are withheld in a bounded
//! in-memory buffer so a refusal-only terminal can advance to the next
//! deployment without exposing the refused route; mixed output or buffer
//! overflow commits and flushes. Candidate
//! selection policy (health circuits, budgets, attempt counting) stays in
//! python: the loop only states its position and the classified failure, and
//! the control plane answers with a reservation, a later depth, or
//! exhaustion.
